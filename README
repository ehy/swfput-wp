             A Flash Video Player Plugin for WordPress

    What is it?

         SWFPut is a cleverly named plugin for the popular Word-
    Press content management and weblog software. It provides  a
    video  player  program for the flash plugin and the means to
    configure an instance  with  a  video  source  and  playback
    attributes.   There  are  two separate components: the flash
    video player, and the WP plugin proper.  The video player is
    delivered  to site visitors by the plugin in the traditional
    <object ...> block with the necessary arguments. Flash video
    objects  may  be placed in posts and pages, or in the widget
    areas supported by your theme (i.e., the plugin  includes  a
    widget).   Video  is placed in posts and pages with a short-
    code; if you do not know what a shortcode is, or do not want
    to  deal  with  them,  that's  no  problem.  (In fact, it is
    preferable that the shortcodes not be hand-edited, and  they
    will  not  be  discussed in detail here.) The plugin adds to
    the administrative interface a full featured form  to  setup
    and  add, or edit, or delete video objects, so the user does
    not need to be troubled with shortcodes (they will be  visi-
    ble  in  the  editor; you will get used to them).  The flash
    video widget has a similar full featured form.

         The plugin does not add any  JavaScript  to  the  pages
    generated  for  your visitors, which might be helpful if you
    try keep your pages useful to those who  disable  JavaScript
    in  their  browser. (Such visitors might need to explicitely
    enable the flash plugin, but  that  is  another  unavoidable
    issue.)   JavaScript is used in the administrative interface
    for the forms and manipulation of shortcodes in the  editor;
    but  of course you must have JavaScript enabled when you log
    in to your site--this does not affect your visitors.

    Building From the Source

         SWFPut is distributed as a  ZIP  archive  prepared  for
    installation  on  a  WordPress  site with the "Add New" item
    under the "Plugins" menu.  Therefore, there is  no  need  to
    build the package before use.

         The   actual  plugin  is  composed  of  PHP  code,  and
    JavaScript for the  administrative  parts,  and  neither  of
    those requires compilation or link editing.  The flash video









                                 -2-


    player is a compiled program, but binaries are  included  in
    the  installable package so that use does not require compi-
    lation by the user. Of course, the source code  is  included
    and  the  binaries  may  be built if necessary (or desired).
    Compiling the flash program will require the Ming PHP exten-
    sion.  See  the  files  Makefile,  mingtest/mingput.php, and
    mingtest/mainact.inc.php if you wish to learn to  build  the
    player.

         If you wish to change the JavaScript code, edit js/for-
    mxed.dev.js, rather than js/formxed.dev.js.  The  latter  is
    merely a compacted version of the former; see Makefile.

    Running

         SWFPut  will run as an application or applet.  The same
    set of classes are used except for the class containing  the
    entry  point,  which  differs  for each.  The application is
    invoked via FractalForge.class and the applet  via  FractAp-
    plet.class.  (The  application uses one additional class not
    used by the  application.)   The  file  FractApplet.html  is
    included  to  help  run the applet with Java's appletviewer.
    FractalForge.bat is a simple DOS batch file that  DOS  users
    can  run  the application with, and FractalForge is a simple
    /bin/sh script.  Both of these scripts expect to be  invoked
    from  the directory containing the class files. If the class
    files are installed in a library directory, then  edit  your
    script as necessary.

         The  application  version  can  save images in the .PPM
    format.  When run as an applet image saving menu  items  are
    disabled.
