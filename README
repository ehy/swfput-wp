                  Mandelbrot Set Generator in Java

    What is it?

         SWFPut  is  a Java program demonstrating the generation
    of  Mandelbrot  set  and  Julia  set  images.   SWFPut  also
    includes  an  adaptation  of  the  program  ppmforge by John
    Walker.  The fractal planet image generator is a  Java  port
    of the ppmforge code.  The C program ppmforge is included in
    the pbmplus and netpbm raster image processing utility pack-
    ages.   For  the  netpbm  package  see http://netpbm.source-
    forge.net/.

    Building From the Source

         The source directories  contain  simple  Makefiles  for
    building the .class files.  Makefile.unix is written for GNU
    gmake but is probably usable with no  or  few  changes  with
    most  Unix  make  utilities.   Makefile.dos  is  written for
    Symantec's smake, and might be a better starting  point  for
    other DOS make utilities.

         The  makefiles have a target named "zip" for generating
    a jar archive.

    Running

         SWFPut will run as an application or applet.  The  same
    set  of classes are used except for the class containing the
    entry point, which differs for  each.   The  application  is
    invoked  via  FractalForge.class and the applet via FractAp-
    plet.class. (The application uses one additional  class  not
    used  by  the  application.)   The  file FractApplet.html is
    included to help run the applet  with  Java's  appletviewer.
    FractalForge.bat  is  a simple DOS batch file that DOS users
    can run the application with, and FractalForge is  a  simple
    /bin/sh  script.  Both of these scripts expect to be invoked
    from the directory containing the class files. If the  class
    files  are  installed in a library directory, then edit your
    script as necessary.

         The application version can save  images  in  the  .PPM
    format.   When  run as an applet image saving menu items are
    disabled.
