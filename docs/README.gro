What is it?
.PP
\fBSWFPut\fP is a Java program demonstrating the
generation of Mandelbrot set and Julia set images.
\fBSWFPut\fP also includes an adaptation of
the program \fBppmforge\fP by John Walker.
The fractal planet image generator
is a Java port of
the \fBppmforge\fP code.
The C program \fBppmforge\fP is included
in the \fIpbmplus\fP and \fInetpbm\fP raster
image processing utility packages.
For the netpbm package see
\f(CRhttp://netpbm.sourceforge.net/\fR.
.SH
Building From the Source
.PP
The source directories contain simple
Makefiles for building the \fB.class\fP
files.
\fIMakefile.unix\fP is written for
\fIGNU\fP \fBgmake\fP but is probably usable
with no or few changes
with most \fIUnix\fP make utilities.
\fIMakefile.dos\fP is written for
\fISymantec\fP's \fBsmake\fP,
and might be a better starting point for
other \fIDOS\fP make utilities.
.PP
The makefiles have a target named \(lqzip\(rq
for generating a \fBjar\fP archive.
.SH
Running
.PP
\fBSWFPut\fP will run as an application or applet.
The same set of classes are used except for the
class containing the entry point, which differs
for each.  The application is invoked via 
\fBFractalForge.class\fP and the applet via
\fBFractApplet.class\fP. (The application uses
one additional class not used by the application.)
The file \fIFractApplet.html\fP is included to
help run the applet with \fIJava\fP's \fBappletviewer\fP.
\fIFractalForge.bat\fP is a simple \fIDOS\fP
batch file that \fIDOS\fP users can run the
application with, and \fIFractalForge\fP is
a simple \fI/bin/sh\fP script.
Both of these scripts expect to be invoked from
the directory containing the class files. If the
class files are installed in a library directory,
then edit your script as necessary.
.PP
The application version can save
images in the \fB.PPM\fP format.
When run as an applet image saving menu
items are disabled.

the distribution archive are under the
